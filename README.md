# Resources

* [Sitepoint CSS Image Grid](https://www.sitepoint.com/using-modern-css-to-build-a-responsive-image-grid/)
  * I used this link to build my image gallery.  I really like the layout, it's responsiveness, and how all the images are aligned in a symmetrical grid.  This link can be seen on my photo gallery page.* [CSS Speech Bubble](http://codepen.io/kaisermann/pen/xZWVrG)
  * I used a variation of this code to generate the speech bubbles that can be seen on the contact page.  I incorporated these links that will display the phone number and email address of the restaurant.* [Button Animation](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_buttons_animate3)
  * I used this code as well to create my Nintendo push button effect for my see map button.  I used Javascript to create a modal to a screen shot of the restaurant's location.

* [Map Javascript Modal](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modal_images.asp)
  * I used this link to create my modal using CSS and Javascript.  This can be seen on the contact page.  When the "see map" button is clicked, it enlarges to a full screen that displays the restaurant's location on a map.

* [Responsive Slides Plugin](http://www.responsiveslides.com/)
  * Here is the link to my slideshow jQuery plugin.  I used this plugin to create a slideshow that cycles through the restaurant's daily specials.  The slideshow is fully responsive and can be found on the events page.

* [Navigational Menu Plugin](http://callmenick.com/post/simple-responsive-navigation-menu)
  * This is a jQuery plugin I used to create my responsive navigational menu.  I can be seen across all pages.  I really like this plugin as it breaks the mobile menu down into a single, clean, drop down menu.

I really enjoyed this assignment and putting all of the things I learned into a functional site!  I think it turned out pretty good and I am really anxious to get going on my personal site using these acquired skills! _Thank you!_
